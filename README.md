# SwarmFitting
Implementation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method.
The method is implemented to determine the values of the standard deviations (sigma) of the Gaussian noise in the N-dimensional linear Hopf model.
Synthetic data is generated with a given sigma values, and then the algorithm is tested to see if they can be recovered.
The Jupyter Notebook has the necessary explanations and comments.
